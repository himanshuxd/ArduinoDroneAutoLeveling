# Arduino Drone Auto Leveling

This repository contains the source code and documentation for an Auto Leveling Drone built using Arduino Uno REV2 and the MPU 6050 Gyro/Accelerometer. The project aimed to create a stable and easy-to-control drone by leveraging sensor data to maintain a level flight.

## Features

- **Auto Leveling:** Utilizes the MPU 6050 Gyro/Accelerometer to maintain a stable and level flight.
- **Arduino Uno REV2:** The drone is powered by Arduino Uno REV2 for easy customization and programming.
- **Customizable:** Users can tweak parameters and customize the code for specific applications and modify the code to be compatible with other sensors.

## Hardware Requirements

- Arduino Uno REV2
- MPU 6050 Gyro/Accelerometer
- Drone assembly with 4 Rotors
- Batteries

## Software Requirements

- Arduino IDE
